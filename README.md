# Agda-TUI

A Terminal User Interface for interactive view and visualization of programs and proof 
that are written in *Agda*.

# Inspiration

I would like to thank [@wvhulle](https://github.com/wvhulle) and his [lean-tui](https://codeberg.org/wvhulle/lean-tui) project, 
that made me start this new project that I would like to work on. It perfectly combines my love for logic and
mathematics and computer science. I have some experience with both Agda (which, incidentally,
is also the focus of my bachelor's thesis) and Ratatui (a little hobby for learning Rust), so
let's see how far I can go.

# Roadmap

- [ ] UI Skeleton
- [ ] Communication Pipeline (IPC)
- [ ] Editor Proxy
- [ ] Connecting the Proxy to the TUI
- [ ] Build the Agda parser and...
- [ ] display it on the TUI
